# 3D renders

The product and engineering images in `assets/img/renders/` are rendered from the three.js scenes in this folder.

```bash
cd tools/renders
npm install three@0.169 playwright
python3 -m http.server 8790 &      # serve this folder
mkdir -p out && node render.mjs hero   # writes out/hero.png (scene name = file in scenes/)
```

Then convert to WebP into `assets/img/renders/`. Edit a scene file to change models, colours, camera or lighting.
